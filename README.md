# Flashlight
_1-st project from __iOS Development with Swift__ training course at Moscow Digital Academy_


This is a simple app that makes lit both the screen and the flashlight (if it is availble on a device).

### Basic functions
 - Initially the screen and flashlight are __off__.
 - On each tap the screen switches its state to the next one through the following sequence: __off__&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;__white__&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;__red__&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;__yellow__&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;__green__&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;__off__. 
 - The flashlight will lit in all states when the screen is not __off__.
 - The screen and flashlight luminocity could be adjusted by swipes:
     - swipe up increases luminocity even from the __off__ state
     - swipe down decreases luminocity down to the __off__ state
